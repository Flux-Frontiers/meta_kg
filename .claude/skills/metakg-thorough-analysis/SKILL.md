# MetaKG Thorough Pathway Analysis Skill

## Overview

Performs comprehensive graph analysis of a MetaKG metabolic pathway database,
analogous to the `codekg-thorough-analysis` skill but applied to biochemical networks.
Extracts metrics like:

- **Hub metabolites** (highest connectivity — cofactors, energy carriers)
- **Complex reactions** (most substrates/products — rate-limiting steps)
- **Cross-pathway junctions** (metabolites bridging multiple pathways)
- **Pathway coupling** (tightly interdependent pathway pairs)
- **Topological patterns** (dead-end metabolites, isolated nodes, metabolic cycles)
- **Top enzymes** (broadest catalytic coverage)

### Code ↔ Metabolism Analogy

| Code concept                | Metabolic equivalent                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Function                    | Reaction (transforms inputs → outputs)            |
| Module / Package            | Pathway (group of related reactions)              |
| Variable / data type        | Compound / metabolite                             |
| Method implementation       | Enzyme (executes the reaction)                    |
| Most-called function (fan-in) | Hub metabolite (in many reactions)              |
| Orchestrator function (fan-out) | Complex reaction (many substrates/products)  |
| Shared utility module       | Cross-pathway compound (bridges many pathways)    |
| Tightly coupled modules     | Strongly coupled pathways (shared compounds)      |
| Dead / orphaned code        | Dead-end or isolated metabolite                   |

- "which pathways are tightly coupled?"

## Strategy

### Phase 1: Graph Statistics & Baseline

```
1. Get overall database metrics: MetaStore.stats()
   - Total nodes / edges by kind
   - Edge density by relation type (SUBSTRATE_OF, PRODUCT_OF, CATALYZES, CONTAINS, …)

2. Per-pathway profiles
   - Reaction count per pathway (size)
   - Compound count per pathway
   - Enzyme count per pathway
```

### Phase 2: Hub Metabolite Analysis (Fan-In equivalent)

```
For each compound, count:
  - Reactions it feeds INTO as substrate (SUBSTRATE_OF edges out)
  - Reactions it is PRODUCED BY as product (PRODUCT_OF edges in)

Sort by total reaction participation.

Expected top hits: ATP, ADP, NAD+, NADH, CoA, Pyruvate, Acetyl-CoA, Pi

Interpretation:
  - High reaction_count → metabolic hub (often a cofactor / energy carrier)
  - High pathway_count → cross-pathway integration point
  - Substrate-heavy → primarily consumed (energy input, electron donor)
  - Product-heavy  → primarily generated (end-product, energy output)
```

### Phase 3: Complex Reaction Analysis (Fan-Out equivalent)

```
For each reaction, count:
  - Substrates (incoming SUBSTRATE_OF edges)
  - Products (outgoing PRODUCT_OF edges)
  - Enzymes (incoming CATALYZES edges)

Sort by (substrate_count + product_count) — "stoichiometric complexity".

Interpretation:
  - complexity > 6 → multi-substrate reaction, often an allosteric control point
  - High enzyme_count → reaction catalysed by multiple enzymes (isoenzymes / redundancy)
  - High pathway_count → shared reaction appearing in many pathway definitions
```

### Phase 4: Cross-Pathway Hub Detection

```
Build compound → {pathway_ids} membership map (via CONTAINS + reaction membership).

Filter: compounds in 2+ distinct pathways.

Sort by pathway_count descending.

Interpretation:
  - pathway_count >= 5 → major junction metabolite
  - pathway_count = 2–4 → bridge between two metabolic subsystems
  - These are prime targets for studying inter-pathway regulation
```

### Phase 5: Pathway Coupling Analysis

```
For every pair of pathways (A, B):
  - Compute shared_compounds = membership[A] ∩ membership[B]
  - Sort pairs by |shared_compounds| descending

Interpretation:
  - shared_count >= 10 → tightly coupled, likely analysed together in biology
  - shared_count = 1–3 → loose coupling, one or two handoff metabolites
  - These pairs should be co-visualised in the Streamlit explorer
```

### Phase 6: Topological Pattern Detection

```
1. Dead-end metabolites
   - Compounds with exactly 1 reaction connection
   - substrate-only → pure inputs (glucose, O2, external nutrients)
   - product-only   → terminal products (CO2, H2O, biomass components)

2. Isolated nodes
   - Nodes (any kind) with zero edges
   - Likely parsing artefacts or incomplete data files

3. Metabolic cycle detection (future)
   - BFS/DFS from each compound looking for self-loops
   - Classic examples: TCA cycle, urea cycle, purine salvage
```

### Phase 7: Top Enzyme Coverage

```
For each enzyme, count CATALYZES edges (reactions it can catalyse).

Sort descending.

Interpretation:
  - High coverage → multi-functional enzyme (e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase family)
  - EC number 1.x.x.x → oxidoreductase (ubiquitous, expect high counts)
  - Enzymes with many reactions but few pathways → pathway-specific specialists
```

### Phase 8: Actionable Biological Insights

```
Compile findings into:
1. Energy cofactor dominance — flag ATP/NAD+/CoA as expected hubs
2. Top metabolic junction — the single highest cross-pathway compound
3. Tightest pathway coupling — the pathway pair with most shared metabolites
4. Dead-end inventory — substrate-only vs product-only breakdown
5. Data completeness warnings — isolated nodes, parsing gaps
6. Drug target candidates — high-complexity reactions with known enzyme coverage
```

## Key Features

✅ **Comprehensive** — All 7 analysis phases, covering topology and biology
✅ **Actionable** — Identifies specific compounds/reactions/enzymes to investigate
✅ **Biologically grounded** — Insight labels aware of cofactor biology
✅ **Fast** — Pure SQLite aggregate queries, no in-memory graph construction
✅ **Reusable** — Works on any MetaKG database regardless of input format
✅ **Extensible** — Add custom phases via `PathwayAnalyzer` subclass

## Edge Cases

- **Cofactor inflation** — ATP/NAD appear in nearly every pathway; expected high scores
- **Sparse data** — Single-pathway databases will show no cross-pathway hubs
- **KGML compound nodes** — KEGG maps often include "undefined" compounds; expected in dead-ends
- **Multi-format data** — Mix KGML + SBML + BioPAX for richer compound coverage

## Future Enhancements

1. **Metabolic cycle detection** — BFS-based cycle finding (TCA, urea cycle, purine salvage)
2. **Flux balance proxies** — Estimate metabolic load from stoichiometry
3. **Drug target scoring** — Rank reactions by target tractability × pathway essentiality
4. **Temporal analysis** — Compare two MetaKG snapshots (before/after data update)
5. **MCP tool integration** — Expose analysis results via `metakg-mcp` tools
6. **Interactive report** — Streamlit dashboard for the analysis output
