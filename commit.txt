fix: Resolve Pylance type errors and code linting issues

Add MetaIndex.stats() method to resolve type checking errors and fix import
ordering and code quality issues detected by Ruff.

Fixed:
- Added MetaIndex.stats() method returning indexed row count and embedding dim
- Fixed import ordering in simulation_demo.py (json, sys, pathlib)
- Fixed import ordering in orchestrator.py and test_orchestrator.py
- Removed f-string prefixes from non-placeholder strings (F541)
- Removed unused imports (tempfile, pathlib.Path) from tests

Quality improvements:
- All files pass Ruff linting checks (I001, F541, F401)
- Type checking passes with mypy
- All 76 tests still passing
- No regressions in functionality

CHANGELOG.md updated with fixes section detailing code quality improvements.
