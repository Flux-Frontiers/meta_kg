chore: Format codebase and improve maintainability across all modules

Standardize code formatting and add author attribution across the entire project:

- Added author name and revision timestamps to 20+ module docstrings
- Standardized import ordering (alphabetical) across all Python files
- Improved SQL query readability with multi-line formatting
- Aligned inline comments and formatted __all__ lists consistently
- Enhanced docstring formatting in data classes and analyzer functions
- All changes pass Ruff formatting, type checking, and linting

This comprehensive cleanup improves code maintainability and consistency
without changing any functional behavior.
